.SH NAME
igrep \- search images for matching metadata
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B igrep
.RI [ options ] " pattern files" ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" TeX users may be more comfortable with the \fB<whatever>\fP and
.\" \fI<whatever>\fP escape sequences to invode bold face and italics,
.\" respectively.
The \fBigrep\fP utility is invoked as follows:

.B igrep
.RI [ options ] " pattern filename" ...

Where pattern is a POSIX.2 regular expression (just like the
Unix/Linux \fBgrep\fP(1) command), and filename (and any following names)
specify images or directories that should be searched. An image file
will "match" if any of its metadata contains values contain
substring that are recognized regular expression. The image files may
be of any format recognized by OpenImageIO (i.e., for which ImageInput
plugins are available).

Example:

.nf
$ igrep Jack *.jpg
bar.jpg: Keywords = Carly; Jack
foo.jpg: Keywords = Jack
test7.jpg: ImageDescription = Jack on vacation
.fi
